# NCCalculator
A Simple Night Crows Calculator written in Python!

This automates all computations that you might need and shows results with only 3 inputs from the user

You can copy and paste the source code in a Web Compiler if you don't want to run the .EXE file in your Computer (https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)

I'll consider making a proper GUI soon (not sure when)

## How to Use:
1. Select an Option
2. Input the amount of CROWs you are spending
3. Input the price that you are going to buy a TOKEN
4. Input the price that you will sell the TOKEN in-game

## Note/s:
1. The calculator assumes that you will SELL ALL the TOKENS, it does not compensate whether you will keep some to yourself
