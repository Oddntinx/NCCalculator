# NCCalculator
A Simple Night Crows Calculator written in Python!

This automates all computations that you might need and shows results with only 3 inputs from the user

You can copy and paste the source code in a Web Compiler if you don't want to run the .EXE file in your Computer

I'll consider making a proper GUI soon (not sure when)

If you want to support me, you can buy me a coffee @ https://ko-fi.com/xhenoa
